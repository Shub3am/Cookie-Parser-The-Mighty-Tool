# Cookie-Parser-The-Mighty-Tool
#### My Own Cookie-Parser: Because Who Needs Pre-Existing Solutions Anyway?

I, a humble genius, was reading through the documentation on cookies when it dawned on me: why can't we just use cookies directly? Who needs cookies-parser? So, in my infinite wisdom, I decided to create my own cookie-parser implementation to prove once and for all that I don't need no stinking documentation.

As you may have guessed, most of the repositories on my impressive GitHub account are personal implementations of various concepts and tools that I find completely fascinating. This specific project converts cookies from a request into a usable format, making them as easy to work with as a walk in the park. Clearly, my contributions to the world of cookie-parsing will be remembered for centuries to come.

Enough Sarcasm?? I guess so!!
